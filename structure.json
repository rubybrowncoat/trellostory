          "After negotiating the Horoopolis Canals as common traders and unremarkable foreign travellers, the crew of the Vyłŭtåið Drakkar sails directly to Rome. They ditch their covering rags in the night and small groups of Kryėgř assault the ports of Misenum, Centum Cellae and Ostia under the cover of cloaking personal artefacts virtually unopposed. Their light-shooting weapons make short, melting work of the defensive Mechanici of the Republican Navy and the bloodseekers deal easily with any human unfortunate enough to meet the blades. The small land parties coalesce into one unit among the streets of Metropolitan Rome and are joined by the remaining troops as they head for the Collis Capitōlīnus guided by the Blööðølyktř. Dispersing into tiny one or two-man teams the one hundred strong military Vikings start moving from villa to villa the soldiers gathering political and economic hostages, and killing military leaders of the city's defensive and administrative organization, stealthily avoiding the main garrisons and concentrations of citizens. The units recover numerous artefacts from the most influential families in Rome, even more from the offices of Roman institutions and the most secret and valuable ones from forges and secret hideouts of the Purpura Officium itself. These include some of the most powerful and unstable artifacts in the world: the Armour of Achilles, the Veil of Isis, the Aegis, Morgelai, Caladbolg, the Rod of Asclepius, Ascalon, Xiuhcoatl, the Girdle of Hippolyta, the Kaustubha, the Lia Fáil, the Book of Thoth, the Orichalcum Samples and several flasks of Ambrosia, among many, many others. The Mechanic police and soldiers operating in the assaulted locations are powerless to stop the foreign high-tech assault, but some manage to trigger their emergency signals before they are dismantled. Soon the authorities, warned by the signals, can organize a strong response, surround the area, and initiate search and destroy missions with Manipulī of military Mechanici to sweep the streets and villas. As the moment of greater vulnerability for the Vikings dispersed throughout the city arrives and settles, with everyone surrounded, some under attack at that very instant and others under imminent threat, the signal is given from the Drakkar and it bellows forth from the Brísingamen around every Viking soldier's neck warning them to Extricate. The many not busy fighting gather their spoils and kill their hostages before smashing together their 雙錢 (shuāngqián) coins. The coins twinkle on contact and the users disappear with everything they were in wilful contact with. They reappear on the Drakkar a few minutes later, and after a few more minutes, the Yggřasiłŭŷfårið sounds his Gjallarhorn Olifant. The ship vanishes and Roman Republican authorities are left to deal with the first sack of Rome in millennia."

          "After the discovery of Element 126, the Company is faced with a problem: no tool is strong enough to mine the element. While the board evaluates whether to risk investing the year’s almost entire research budget in a desperate attempt to find a way, a small group of three individuals offers the CEO an alternative: they will give them the means to get the Scrith, but will require over 30% of the raw material in return each month, delivered to a specific site in the region. \nThe CEO accepts, and they give him a machine with a Scrith blade. The Company’s scientists, some of the finest minds and best paid minds of the world, quickly figure out how to reproduce the rest of the machine. The CEO orders his mercenaries to apprehend the three travellers, who do not oppose any resistance but remind him of their deal. After a month has passed, they ask the guards to relay a message to the CEO: they want their 30%. After a week has passed with no response, the three Lummentravellers appear in front of the board during a meeting and make quick work of them and of the guards, except one, whom is asked to relay the same message: deliver the 30% from now on. \nThe material is quickly delivered to the indicated site by the new member of the board.

          "The rumour that a very large quantity of element 126 was found brings much concern in the Norman labs, and the concern escalates all the way up to the Throne of Grande-Bretagne: this could deal a significant blow to the nuclear research industry of the country. Hoping to exert pressure on the Indian government by virtue of a long-standing, albeit frail, friendship, Queen Louarn sends a discreet dispatch to the Indian diplomacy.\n\nA week later, she has not received any answer, so she attempts a second message. Having received no further answer, she takes matters in her own hand and travels to the Indian capital with a handful of most trustworthy guards. As soon as she leaves the palace, three strangely dressed men appear out of thin air, wielding shiny firearms, and easily overcome the guards.\n\nThe Queen blinks and, when her eyes open, she finds herself in what appears to be a windowless laboratory, not dissimilar from the Norman ones, but full of brown-skinned scientists. Anjit Brahamanan Singh, a very old friend of the Norman Crown and now part of the top Indian diplomacy, greets her and shows her around the lab. As it turns out, element 126 is highly sought by some extracontextus travellers, who are prepared to exchange it for various riches and much valued scientific and technological knowledge.\n\nAnjit and Louarn convene to keep the find secret. In exchange for stronger political, military, and commercial support form Grande-Bretagne to India, the Indians agree to share profits and knowledge resulting from the sale of 126.\n\nIn a blink of her eyes, the Queen is back on her throne."

Every major and minor power reached by the news of the injection of advanced technology in the conflict tries to get their hands on the new weaponry, but the Vikings soon prove to be interested in just one kind of good: extra-contextus artifacts coming from the Unreachable Dimension whose Blood led them there in the first place.",

          "A squad of miners, sent to investigate a huge and sudden blast in the deepest part of an arzebian bauxite mine, hastily runs back to the surface claming the whole place is cursed. During a further interrogation, the workers talk about strange, dark fissures on the tunnel walls. Scary noises and ominous, unintellegible words appear to be originating from them. The word spreads among other miners, and many of them start refusing to get back to work until the tunnels are sealed again.\n\n\n## Lethal Weapon (_Dark_)\n\n**Question**: _What is the reason behind the sealing of the tunnels?_\n**Stage**: _Interrogation room, Praefectura in the city of Baku, the nearest to the mine_\n**Characters**: _Sertorius Macro, Praefectus Vigilum of Baku; Əliyev, bauxite miner; Severus Vigiles, mechanical Servitor for the Vigiles of Baku_\n\n\n**Notes**\n_Defixiones: curse tablets used in the Roman world to communicate with the dead_\n_Praefectus Vigilum: imperial official commanding the policemen of a city_\n\n**Answer**:\n\n_How can you even hope that I don’t throw your ass in the dirtiest cell here for this stupid story and for refusing to work, uh?!_\n\n_But… defixiones, defixiones!_\n\n_Aaaaahhhhh, magnus Iuppiter… pfff… I should have left this problem to Maximus Aurelius, the Praefectus Urbi… and NO_ \nHe points his finger, trembling with frustration, at Severus, sitting beside him in and calmly throbbing its fingers rhythmically on its runic chestplate.\n_Don’t you even dare to remind me of my stupid jurisdiction, I know the rules.\nOkay, Əliyev, let’s calm down and talk through what happened last night and how you survived that blast. If you tell me everything you saw, I will ask the Augures to read the birds for you, they will do something for these… maledictions._\n\n_…Yes, sir. Well, me and my mates and the turn leader, we were fixing the rope handrail for the new tunnel, see? That’s what we gotta do, when we push farther down the mine. The stone, it’s shinier down, but the road is rough, I’ve seen many folks falling over their instrument and breaking – themselves or the machines, what’s worst. \nWell, we were down, and I take the drill, see? And I start drilling the holes, but the stone was soft there, too soft. Not the usual one, I say to the turn leader, but he says go on! So we go on, right? But I want to see the soft stone, so I drill a hole up, a couple down, and I strip a piece of stone. And BAM! The rock was blue. Blue like water! I go near it, ‘cause I want to see it, maybe is sapphire, maybe I get to be rich, but no. Nonono._\n_I see better and I see men-like figures. But they had no eyes, no face, no nothing. They looked like dead. And then… some shiny metal sting gets out of that blue rock. I take my drill, I try to hit it. Don’t know what I’m thinking. But I do it. The sting falls, I take it in my hands. I raise my eyes, and the dead start moving and hissing. I turn to the sting, I read some letters or symbols, and I freak out. It’s a defixiones from the dead! The dead cursed me!\nThe rock starts glowing lighter and the tunnel to tremble. I freak out, I run away. I black out and just run, run, run, while the tremble grows louder.\nWhen I calm down, I look back. See nothing, but hear a blast. I get out. That’s it._\n\n_So, Əliyev, you say that the blast was somehow created by this blue rip in the rock when you touched the sting, am I right? What about the metal sting?_\n\nƏliyev nods and takes out of his pocket a small, cylindrical object with a hole inside supported by a rectangular base. It’s heavy, its polished surface and the smoothed angles suggest some kind of manufacturing. Sertorius closely looks at the base, where some kind of obscure symbols are carved. He passes the object to Severus. \n_Never seen a mine where metal goes in and doesn’t go out. What do you say?_\n\n_It’s definitely made by somebody, or some machine._\nSeverus weighs the objects in its hands, inspecting it closely and beating it against the table of the room to hear its sound.\n\n_Well, shit, this is too much. I’ll go smoke something and to call the Augures, be right back._\n\nHe lights up a cigarette and wonders: is that some kind of sick payback from the gods, who looked down at his past pride and deemed it so shameful to inflict him another punishment? \nHe remembers 3 years before, the day he accepted the position as Praefectus Vigilum in Baku. The glory and the respect he dreamt he would have gained as Praefectus, the thrill of the action in the city. His laughs and smiles, crushing and crumbling against his wife’s skepticism, then doubt, then disagreement, then hostility. She always loved that domus near Massalia, but he was yearning for more.\nOf course, he was wrong. About Baku, that dead city. About that job, so boring and pointless. And about Massalia, how he missed it and his domina… \n\nA dull noise surprises him, taking him back to reality; he rushes back to the room, where Severus is standing near a lying Əliyev, his Adam’s apple black and tumid.\n\n_We… ehm, I suggest those tunnels should be sealed. This is serious, and it’s now a matter of CYPLEUM. Sertorius, I already contacted them, in these cases I’m duty-bound to, for the greater good. For your safety I think you should go away and forget. Even if it probably won’t make any difference, since I already told you too much. You see what I had to do to Əliyev._\n\n_Whatever. I’m too old for this shit, anyway. Good bye._\n\nHe walks out of the room and the building. The streets are desert and the lights are dim. What a stupid city.\n"

That’s it._\n\n_So, Əliyev, you say that the blast was somehow created by this blue rip in the rock when you touched the sting, am I right? What about the metal sting?_\n\nƏliyev nods and takes out of his pocket a small, cylindrical object with a hole inside supported by a rectangular base. It’s heavy, its polished surface and the smoothed angles suggest some kind of manufacturing. Sertorius closely looks at the base, where some kind of obscure symbols are carved. He passes the object to Severus. \n_Never seen a mine where metal goes in and doesn’t go out. What do you say?_\n\n_It’s definitely made by somebody, or some machine._\nSeverus weighs the objects in its hands, inspecting it closely and beating it against the table of the room to hear its sound.\n\n_Well, shit, this is too much. I’ll go smoke something and to call the Augures, be right back._\n\nHe lights up a cigarette and wonders: is that some kind of sick payback from the gods, who looked down at his past pride and deemed it so shameful to inflict him another punishment? \nHe remembers 3 years before, the day he accepted the position as Praefectus Vigilum in Baku. The glory and the respect he dreamt he would have gained as Praefectus, the thrill of the action in the city. His laughs and smiles, crushing and crumbling against his wife’s skepticism, then doubt, then disagreement, then hostility. She always loved that domus near Massalia, but he was yearning for more.\nOf course, he was wrong. About Baku, that dead city. About that job, so boring and pointless. And about Massalia, how he missed it and his domina… \n\nA dull noise surprises him, taking him back to reality; he rushes back to the room, where Severus is standing near a lying Əliyev, his Adam’s apple black and tumid.\n\n_We… ehm, I suggest the mines should be closed. This is serious, and it’s now a matter of CYPLEUM. Sertorius, I already contacted them, in these cases I’m duty-bound to, for the greater good. For your safety I think you should go away and forget. Even if it probably won’t make any difference, since I already told you too much. You see what I had to do to Əliyev._\n\n_Whatever. I’m too old for this shit, anyway. Good bye._\n\nHe walks out of the room and the building. The streets are desert and the lights are dim. What a stupid city.\n"

If you tell me everything you saw, I will ask the Augures to read the birds for you, they will do something for these… maledictions._\n\n_…Yes, sir. Well, me and my mates and the turn leader, we were fixing the rope handrail for the new tunnel, see? That’s what we gotta do, when we push farther down the mine. The stone, it’s shinier down, but the road is rough, I’ve seen many folks falling over their instrument and breaking – themselves or the machines, what’s worst. \nWell, we were down, and I take the drill, see? And I start drilling the holes, but the stone was soft there, too soft. Not the usual one, I say to the turn leader, but he says go on! So we go on, right? But I want to see the soft stone, so I drill a hole up, a couple down, and I strip a piece of stone. And BAM! The rock was blue. Blue like water! I go near it, ‘cause I want to see it, maybe is sapphire, maybe I get to be rich, but no. Nonono._\n_I see better and I see men-like figures. But they had no eyes, no face, no nothing. They looked like dead. And then… some shiny metal sting gets out of that blue rock. I take my drill, I try to hit it. Don’t know what I’m thinking. But I do it. The sting falls, I take it in my hands. I raise my eyes, and the dead start moving and hissing. I turn to the sting, I read some letters or symbols, and I freak out. It’s a defixiones from the dead! The dead cursed me!\nThe rock starts glowing lighter and the tunnel to tremble. I freak out, I run away. I black out and just run, run, run, while the tremble grows louder.\nWhen I calm down, I look back. See nothing, but hear a blast. I get out. That’s it._\n\n_So, Əliyev, you say that the blast was somehow created by this blue rip in the rock when you touched the sting, am I right?

It’s heavy, its polished surface and the smoothed angles suggest some kind of manufacturing. Sertorius closely looks at the base, where some kind of obscure symbols are carved. He passes the object to Severus. \n_Never seen a mine where metal goes in and doesn’t go out. What do you say?_\n\n_It’s definitely made by somebody, or some machine._\nSeverus weighs the objects in its hands, inspecting it closely and beating it against the table of the room to hear its sound.\n\n_Well, shit, this is too much. I’ll go smoke something and to call the Augures, be right back._\n\nHe lights up a cigarette and wonders: is that some kind of sick payback from the gods, who looked down at his past pride and deemed it so shameful to inflict him another punishment? \nHe remembers 3 years before, the day he accepted the position as Praefectus Vigilum in Baku. The glory and the respect he dreamt he would have gained as Praefectus, the thrill of the action in the city. His laughs and smiles, crushing and crumbling against his wife’s skepticism, then doubt, then disagreement, then hostility. She always loved that domus near Massalia, but he was yearning for more.\nOf course, he was wrong. About Baku, that dead city. About that job, so boring and pointless. And about Massalia, how he missed it and his domina… \n\nA dull noise surprises him, taking him back to reality; he rushes back to the room, where Severus is standing near a lying Əliyev, his Adam’s apple black and tumid.\n\n_We… ehm, I suggest the mines should be closed.

The word spreads among other miners, and many of them start refusing to get back to work until the tunnels are sealed again.\n\n\n## Lethal Weapon (_Dark_)\n\n**Question**: _What caused the blast in the mines? _\n**Stage**: _Interrogation room, Praefectura in the city of Baku, the nearest to the mine_\n**Characters**: _Sertorius Macro, Praefectus Vigilum of Back; Əliyev, bauxite miner; Severus Vigiles, mechanical Servitor for the Vigiles of Baku\n\n**Answer**:\n\n_How can you even hope that I don’t throw your ass in the dirtiest cell here for this stupid story and for refusing to work, uh?!_\n\n_But… defixiones, defixiones!_\n\n_Aaaaahhhhh, magnus Iuppiter… pfff… I should have left this problem to Maximus Aurelius, the Praefectus Urbi… and NO_ \nHe points his finger, trembling with frustration, at Severus, sitting beside him in and calmly throbbing its fingers rhythmically on its runic chestplate.\n_Don’t you even dare to remind me of my stupid jurisdiction, I know the rules.\nOkay, Əliyev, let’s calm down and talk through what happened last night and how you survived that blast. If you tell me everything you saw, I will ask the Augures to read the birds for you, they will do something for these… maledictions._\n\n_…Yes, sir. Well, me and my mates and the turn leader, we were fixing the rope handrail for the new tunnel, see? That’s what we gotta do, when we push farther down the mine. The stone, it’s shinier down, but the road is rough, I’ve seen many folks falling over their instrument and breaking – themselves or the machines, what’s worst. \nWell, we were down, and I take the drill, see? And I start drilling the holes, but the stone was soft there, too soft. Not the usual one, I say to the turn leader, but he says go on! So we go on, right? But I want to see the soft stone, so I drill a hole up, a couple down, and I strip a piece of stone. And BAM! The rock was blue. Blue like water! I go near it, ‘cause I want to see it, maybe is sapphire, maybe I get to be rich, but no. Nonono._\n_I see better and I see men-like figures. But they had no eyes, no face, no nothing. They looked like dead. And then… some shiny metal sting gets out of that blue rock. I take my drill, I try to hit it. Don’t know what I’m thinking. But I do it. The sting falls, I take it in my hands. I raise my eyes, and the dead start moving and hissing. I turn to the sting, I read some letters or symbols, and I freak out. It’s a defixiones from the dead! The dead cursed me!\nThe rock starts glowing lighter and the tunnel to tremble. I freak out, I run away. I black out and just run, run, run, while the tremble grows louder.\nWhen I calm down, I look back. See nothing, but hear a blast. I get out. That’s it._\n\n_So, Əliyev, you say that the blast was somehow created by this blue rip in the rock when you touched the sting, am I right? What about the metal sting?_\n\nƏliyev nods and takes out of his pocket a small, cylindrical object with a hole inside supported by a rectangular base. It’s heavy, its polished surface and the smoothed angles suggest some kind of manufacturing. Sertorius closely looks at the base, where some kind of obscure symbols are carved. He passes the object to Severus. \n_Never seen a mine where metal goes in and doesn’t go out. What do you say?_\n\n_It’s definitely made by somebody, or some machine._\nSeverus weighs the objects in its hands, inspecting it closely and beating it against the table of the room to hear its sound.\n\n_Well, shit, this is too much. I’ll go smoke something and to call the Augures, be right back._\n\nHe lights up a cigarette and wonders: is that some kind of sick payback from the gods, who looked down at his past pride and deemed it so shameful to inflict him another punishment? \nHe remembers 3 years before, the day he accepted the position as Praefectus Vigilum in Baku. The glory and the respect he dreamt he would have gained as Praefectus, the thrill of the action in the city. His laughs and smiles, crushing and crumbling against his wife’s skepticism, then doubt, then disagreement, then hostility. She always loved that domus near Massalia, but he was yearning for more.\nOf course, he was wrong. About Baku, that dead city. About that job, so boring and pointless. And about Massalia, how he missed it and his domina… \n\nA dull noise surprises him, taking him back to reality; he rushes back to the room, where Severus is standing near a lying Əliyev, his Adam’s apple black and tumid.\n\n_We… ehm, I suggest the mines should be closed. This is serious, and it’s now a matter of CYPLEUM. Sertorius, I already contacted them, in these cases I’m duty-bound to, for the greater good. For your safety I think you should go away and forget. Even if it probably won’t make any difference, since I already told you too much. You see what I had to do to Əliyev._\n\n_Whatever. I’m too old for this shit, anyway. Good bye._\n\nHe walks out of the room and the building. The streets are desert and the lights are dim. What a stupid city.\n"

There could be people who believe in magic, and that express their beliefs through mysticism. Some such people could even organise in cults, that can be open and public, or closed and secretive. The \"magic\" is not necessarily supernatural nor inexplicable. For example, higher-ups in a cult's hierarchy might know perfectly well that what the wider associates believe to be magic is in fact coming from very solid, plain, old, and even boring technology and science. The point is that any sufficiently advanced technology can be seen as magic, and people not-in-the-know can't necessarily be aware of this. On the other hand, they may very well, and yet partake in mysticism around said ordinary contraptions – e.g., the cult of the nut and bolt, that worships a literal combination of a nut and a bolt, and assigns arbitrary values to them, and create an aura of mysticism around such everyday objects.\n\n## Powerful Artifacts\n\nAll Artifacts bestow powers on their owners and/or users. These powers are varied and often unpredictable but reproducible and ultimately controllable. Each artifact has one and only one power. These powers are active in the \"Roman\" dimension but don't manifest or exist in the \"Fallen\" one.

This does not apply to the Fallen universe.\n\n## Mechanical Servitors\n\nThe Empire has built its strength on the back of mechanical servitors. These forged metal constructs are animated and subjugated via alchemical runes etched on their steel and copper chestplates. The alchemical secrets by which these tireless slaves are constructed are kept flawlessly by the Factōrēs Hōrologiōrum, and they build every servitor at the Magna Fornāx deep in the center of Rome. These servitors are built to serve Roman citizens and Roman interests, they are duty-bound to fulfil every whim and carry out every command. The alchemical runes that give these slaves animation also give them sapience and also enforce the unbreakable compulsion to follow their masters' orders. The alchemical bonds occasionally break in accidents, most often resulting in the immediate de-animation of the constructs. In rare cases only the compulsion breaks, but the awakened servitors are swiftly recognized and decommissioned by a Factor at the nearest Fornāx Alimentōrum.\n\n## Parallel Timelines\n\nThere are several alternate dimensions, not just two. \n\n## Caesaropapism\n\nIn all the Empire, religion is under direct control of the emperor.

          "A few weeks after the blast a suspicious group of five masked people is seen hovering around a village near the mines, and a team of CYPLEUM agents is tasked to track and interrogate them.\nThe men are spotted in four different places in the span of a few minutes. All the spots are around the mine, at distances impossible to traverse in that short time. Not long after, a bright red light beacon shoots from the ground at a fifth spot, and screams are heard.\nAgents find three of the men, hoods off, and what appear to be the glowing remains of the other two. One of the surviving men tightly holds a cuboid artifact with bright red glyphs on its sides. The glyphs burn the man's hands, but shock prevents him to let go of it. He reveals that his group comes from the African region of Kitara, and that they are following a path revealed by a book they found years earlier, which the stole from the hands of their tribe, who had banished them because of the book itself.\n«It is too late. We should have drawn the pentangle before the breach; we tried nonetheless, but we have doomed your caves. He took two of our brothers. Fear for your brethren, now.»"

A research outpost is set up on one of the tiny icy islands far enough from people, and the young researchers quickly assembles a small group of bright-minded assistants. Work gets underway, and the initial findings point to a positive outcome for the Mislati.\n\nDuring an experiment designed to attract emberstone pebbles to the surface without causing explosions and eruptions, a thin, brighter-than-daylight ray emanates from the site of the experiment upwards. Everyone within a 50 km radius is temporarily blinded, but otherwise unaffected. As the first people nearest to the research outpost regain their eyesight, and as soon as the ray's brightness is considerably diminished, they rush towards the seemingly unaffected research island, only to find that everything is fine, the everlasting ice cap has thawed, flora is flourishing despite the freezing temperature, and the researchers are unharmed, although visibly shaken and euphoric.\n\nLater that day, when everyone is seeing again, the council of shamans meets the researchers to find out what happened. The young Inuit adventurer describes the experiment in great detail, and stops short of explaining why the emberstones pebbles are nowhere to be seen, and why the area surrounding the bright ray has suddenly become green and lively despite the freezing temperature.\n\nThe younger shamans propose that this has to be seen in light of Ye Ole Myths from the Westlands-over-Seas where a rain of fire and rocks destroyed vast stretches of barren wastelands, restoring their primordial fertility. The older shamans maintain that, during Ragnarok, fire and rocks fell from the sky, and destruction ensued, where here there are no rocks and fire to be seen, apart form the emberstone pebbles that are still safely underground, and the only visible effect is the ray of light, like a beacon to the skies, and a whole lot of inexplicable green. The researchers remind everyone that there is no hard evidence that Ragnarok happened like it is described in the Myths, and thus this could very well be another Ragnarok-type event. At any rate, the researchers ensure that they will continue their work on emberstone extraction, while investigating the new phenomena, which they decided to temporarily name ᒐᙵᓱᑌᓚ (Ganngasutaila)."

Adventurers try to access the territory by any mean necessary, and soon the presence of foreign people determines a heavy disruption in the political and social lifestyle of the african kingdom, expecially due to the introduction of new heresies and, most of all, written documents and papers.  Attempts to exploit the situation are made by the local government, however things go awry and eventually the kingdom is forced to face a failed coup d'état and the consequent (and drastic) countermeasures.",

Over just a few hectic years the secret, undiscovered collaboration between the tribal lords of cold-as-glaciers Vinland and the elder sages of the hot-as-lava Mislati leads to the uncovering of the nature of the Edge of Fire, forging a beneficial and lasting bond between the two people and furthering an already profound but ever deepening understanding among the Thulian academics of the nature and potential of the artifacts flooding ever increasingly into the world.",

          "Commander Aestus is summoned to a remote location by a very inconspicuous messenger. After two days of travel in a blind carriage, he is let outside and into a small, very white, and minimally decorated hall. As soon as all personnel has left the hall, no less than the Queen appears.\n\nShe says that rumours have come to her attention regarding several priceless artefacts, and she wants to obtain them. She does not state the reason for this, but suggests that Aestus puts together a very covert mission to investigate such rumours.\n\nCommander Aestus is led outside the hall and into the carriage again, carrying a bright white finger ring in his pocket. Upon his return to Rome, the army asks him to travel to Taproban and investigate rumours of several extra-contextus artefacts. He is told to acquire them wherever possible because reliable intelligence has it that a previously unknown third party is very interested in them for unknown, but presumably nefarious, reasons."

          "Magister Sabinus looked at the Object, his face showing no emotion. The other associates knew he was admiring their latest work with pride and anguish. Their skill was no mystery. All of them had a quasi-superhuman talent for craftsmanship, an ability to think something vividly and use the world’s tools to make it concrete. The latest Artefact was their new best work, just as the one before it, and the one before that, and the one before that. After a thorough examination, Sabinus deemed the Object up to their standards, but he also maintained that while it was good enough for the present, it might not be enough to confound the future. He reminded them that  Perception was just technology and while they only needed the illusion to last until reality was utterly weakened and the laws of physics too malleable to make a meaningful distinction between their Objects and the Extracontextus Artefacts, that time could be long to come and, in the meanwhile, technological advance could uncover the intra-dimensional nature of their craft. Furthermore, since no one could know the truth behind their Artefacts in the final days, every failure burdened more and more associates with the knowledge that they were dooming the next generation to commit suicide in their place, instead of letting them live in a world of awe and wonder. \nThe Ordo Mundorum, whose mission was to craft a new reality in which mundanity is but a fraught and perfect identity of vision and matter is achieved, release the new True Artefact into the world, in a place known to no one but Magister Sabinus himself, while the ones commissioned by their Roman masters were placed on Taproban, to be used as tools in a petty war.

They think they have detected a pattern, but are still working on it when Aestus and the Scunkii demand to be let through the portal.\n\nDespite resisting, the scientists open the portal, and the eager agents travel through, carrying minimum survival equipment. When the portal closes, the scientists resume their work on aiming the portal, knowing that, otherwise, the Sub Commander Aestus and the top squad of CYPLEUM are forever lost on an alien world."

          "Multiple artefact-modified hot air baloon forays to the Roman-mined Mun (Moon, the inner satellite) have provided Qin atmosphericists with the inkling that the Mantle (the chaotic medium through which Mun travels in its close orbit around Terra) might reach all the way to the end of the atmosphere, to the edge of empty space itself. Many more artefact-enhanced flights tasked to breach this edge have resulted in numerous senseless deaths and an ingrained conviction that this ultimate frontier might be impossible to reach and explore.\n\nAfter stealing several thousand tons of steel, aluminium and related composites from the Roman heavy-industry region of Arzebia Inferior, through several Parthian false-flag attacks, scattering useless artefacts to distract and misdirect local investigations, the Qin Ministry of Shadows is instructed by Qin Shi Zheng Huang the Visionary, King of Qin and Wu, to calculate the requirements for the third phase of operation 滲透面紗 (Pierce the Veil). \n\nQin Shi Zheng Huang travels to the Darkened Citadel under the Mantle. The magnificent phalanx of thirty million Qin soldiers, purposefully arrayed on the open grounds of the secret facility like a giant carpet made of millions upon millions of flag-wielding terra-cotta warriors, fits inside a square six kilometers on each side. At the first signal from Qin Shi Zheng Huang, the phalanx shifts into complicated and detailed circuit patterns that gradually fill the entire formation to form the \"Mother Board\". Groups of two or three soldiers spread into AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, XNOR and NOT logical units througout. The five best divisions under the command of Minister Lü Buwei of the Shadows form the core calculating component, the \"Central Processing Unit\", and several address, register and highly regular stack memory sub-formations. A passage for the cavalry division of the \"System Bus\" runs through the entire formation. Further to the south, on a small cliff overlooking the fields, stands the bottleneck of the entire endeavour, the \"Hard Drive\" building housing three million educated soldiers tasked with writing down results, intermediate calculations and recording everything that happens inside the main formation; a \"Display\" division spreads from the building and updates at periodic intervals to show final results and status updates to the Command Observers. After a second signal from Qin Shi Zheng Huang the elements of the logical components begin running self-contained integrity tests, the \"Input\" soldiers wave their flags and wait for the correct response from their \"Output\" counterparts; malfunctioning or distracted units are replaced swiftly and ruthlessly with soldiers from the reserve. Tens of millions of flags wave across the umbrage plains, sparkling faintly under the weak sun-light filtering from the far horizon. A \"Progress Bar\" of numerous green flags gradually advances through the \"Display\" division indicating the percentage of completed integrity tests. After the completion of the tests, the \"System Bus\" division is ordered to instruct the entire formation to load the \"Qin 1.1\" operating set of system-wide instructions. The cavalry moves swiftly though the components and soon turns into a turbulent river feeding into numerous thin tributaries infiltrating all the modular subformation of the \"Computer Army\". The ripple of black and white flags coalesces into surging waves racing through the entirety of the \"Mother Board\". At this point a third and final signal from Qin Shi Zheng Huang, puts the calculations in motion. The master computing module, the differential calculus module, the finite element analysis module, the spectral method module, the initial memory storage module, and all other operating sub-formations begin pulsing with activity. Thirty million sets of hands sparkle, flash, wave and carry out precise choreographies, as the \"Display\" division struggles to keep up with the information flow, waving indicators of every color and lifting letter boards.\n\nAt the end of its operational cycle, the \"Hard Drive\" division \"saves\" the final results copying them to several hundred scrolls. Travel vectors, stress calculations, manufacturing parameters, and thousands of other precise instructions; everything the King requires to direct Qin builders, engineers and manufacturers. After returning to his palace in the Qin Sea Capital of Shencheng, he gives orders to begin phase four of operation 滲透面紗, that will push the first man-made object past the thick edge of the atmosphere, send the first human into empty space, put the first Qin fully above the Mantle and establish the first settlements on Terra's second satellite visible faintly from the surface of Mun, Luna."

          "Multiple artefact-modified hot air baloon forays to the Roman-mined Mun (Moon, the inner satellite) have provided Qin atmosphericists with the inkling that the Mantle (the chaotic medium through which Mun travels in its close orbit around Terra) might reach all the way to the end of the atmosphere, to the edge of empty space itself. Many more artefact-enhanced flights tasked to breach this edge have resulted in numerous senseless deaths and an ingrained conviction that this ultimate frontier might be impossible to reach and explore.\n\nAfter stealing several thousand tons of steel, aluminium and related composites from the Roman heavy-industry region of Arzebia Inferior, through several Parthian false-flag attacks, scattering useless artefacts to distract and misdirect local investigations, the Qin Ministry of Shadows is instructed by Qin Shi Zheng Huang the Visionary, King of Qin and Wu, to calculate the requirements for the third phase of operation 滲透面紗 (Pierce the Veil). \n\nQin Shi Zheng Huang travels to the Darkened Citadel under the Mantle. The magnificent phalanx of thirty million Qin soldiers, purposefully arrayed on the open grounds of the secret facility like a giant carpet made of millions upon millions of flag-wielding terra-cotta warriors, fits inside a square six kilometers on each side. At the first signal from Qin Shi Zheng Huang, the phalanx shifts into complicated and detailed circuit patterns that gradually fill the entire formation to form the \"Mother Board\". Groups of two or three soldiers spread into AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, XNOR and NOT logical units througout. The five best divisions under the command of Minister Lü Buwei of the Shadows form the core calculating component, the \"Central Processing Unit\", and several address, register and highly regular stack memory sub-formations. A passage for the cavalry division of the \"System Bus\" runs through the entire formation. Further to the south, on a small cliff overlooking the fields, stands the bottleneck of the entire endeavour, the \"Hard Drive\" building housing three million educated soldiers tasked with writing down results, intermediate calculations and recording everything that happens inside the main formation; a \"Display\" division spreads from the building and updates at periodic intervals to show final results and status updates to the Command Observers. After a second signal from Qin Shi Zheng Huang the elements of the logical components begin running self-contained integrity tests, the \"Input\" soldiers wave their flags and wait for the correct response from their \"Output\" counterparts; malfunctioning or distracted units are replaced swiftly and ruthlessly with soldiers from the reserve. Tens of millions of flags wave across the umbrage plains, sparkling faintly under the weak sun-light filtering from the far horizon. A \"Progress Bar\" of numerous green flags gradually advances through the \"Display\" division indicating the percentage of completed integrity tests. After the completion of the tests, the \"System Bus\" division is ordered to instruct the entire formation to load the \"Qin 1.1\" operating set of system-wide instructions. The cavalry moves swiftly though the components and soon turns into a turbulent river feeding into numerous thin tributaries infiltrating all the modular subformation of the \"Computer Army\". The ripple of black and white flags coalesces into surging waves racing through the entirety of the \"Mother Board\". At this point a third and final signal from Qin Shi Zheng Huang, puts the calculations in motion. The master computing module, the differential calculus module, the finite element analysis module, the spectral method module, the initial memory storage module, and all other operating sub-formations begin pulsing with activity. Thirty million sets of hands sparkle, flash, wave and carry out precise choreographies, as the \"Display\" division struggles to keep up with the information flow, waving indicators of every color and lifting letter boards.\n\nAt the end of its operational cycle, the \"Hard Drive\" division \"saves\" the final results copying them to several hundred scrolls. Travel vectors, stress calculations, manufacturing parameters, and thousands of other precise instructions; everything the King requires to direct Qin builders, engineers and manufacturers. After returning to his palace in the Qin Sea Capital of Shencheng, he gives orders to begin phase four of operation 滲透面紗, that will push the first man-made object past the thick edge of the atmosphere, send the first human into space, put the first Qin fully above the Mantle and establish the first settlements on Terra's second satellite visible faintly from the surface of Mun, Luna."

          "The first Parthian expedition to explore Taproban found a series of deeply unusual objects of seemingly unfathomable function and absurd craftsmanship. \nAfter further inquiry, a meeting was called to establish the final truth on these objects. The Kaveh Secretary of Materials, the Esfandyiar Secretary of Religion, and the Suren Ministry of External Affairs and Esptionage all agreed, based on their investigation, that the objects could be traced back to the Ordo Mundorum, a secret cult based in the Eastern Roman Empire and dedicated to destabilising reality by introducing extraneous objects. After a short debate everyone else, including the influential Mihran Ministry of War, agreed to the conclusion and the Definitive Truth on the Taprobanean Objects was proclaimed by the Zoroaster Ministry of Truth and Flame. Evidence of a Roman investigation into the objects were consequently attributed to the Empire’s ongoing war on secret religions, and given limited attention. \nThanks to the Empire’s masterful craftsmen, spies, and diplomats, the Roman plan had succeeded.

          "Iulius Severus Severiustrivantus reaches Londin-dans-les-Montagnes, shows his unmistakable Horologium pendant to the town guards and is immediatelty escorted to the Queen of the Normans. As the confidential information in his possession suggested, her rank is revealed to be just a cerimonial façade: as a matter of fact, she holds no power. Nouveau Grande-Bretagne's form of government is something unconceivable for the rest of the Known World: a mix of hierocracy and technarchy, based on a peculiar, NeoPlatonic-tinged cult of Science and firmly steered by the clever authority of the seventy-fourth Evèque of Nouveau Grande-Bretagne, Remi डम्बर Kirwyn.\nAfter a meticulous and rather embarassing strip-search and short and purely formal audience with the Queen, during which Severus does his best to state his motives as clearly (concerning intentions) and vaguely (concerning information) as possible, he is led to the upper floors of the many-bridged Sky Towers, where he finally meets the Evèque. The two discuss conditions and very restricted information; then consent to the terms of a historical exchange: Severus will submit the Hybernian Artifact and his liberty to the authority of the Evèque, and the Evèque will make him his personal assistant for the ultra-secret _Le Départ_ project, under the new name Pythagoras.\n\n\n\n## Screwy Cogs (_Dark_)\n\n**Question**: _How does project Le Départ relate to the Normans' belief system?_\n**Stage**: _The Hall of the Evèque in the Sky Towers of Londin-dans-les-Montagnes_\n**Characters**: _Iulius Severus Severiustrivantus, Remi डम्बर Kirwyn, seventy-fourth Evèque of Nouveau Grande-Bretagne._\n\n**Answer**:\n\n[Excerpt from the conversation between Remi डम्बर Kirwyn and Iulius Severus Severiustrivantus]\n\n\"I gather that the Queen was not a problem\" Said the dark-skinned Remi, shrouded in his crimson robe.\n\"Not at all, Eminence. She seemed pleased with my patchy report.\" Answered Iulius.\n\"So young, yet so perfect for her role! She's the most impeccably brainless monarch in the last six or seven decades - brainlessness being of course the most important quality for a Norman Monarch besides regal appearance... and the main reason why so many of the last monarchs have been, in fact, monarch_esses_\".\n\"Circumspectors in Rome have been knowing for long that your Queen was a purely cerimonial cover for your technochratic meddlings, but I think nobody, even in the Purpura Officium, ever suspected the extent of her uselessness.\"\n\"Your masters in Rome never suspected of many important matters as far as I know. Starting with your willingness to betray them.\"\n\"Throwing authorities off the scent is my most obvious skill. I didn't succeed with your men just because I didn't even try.\"\n\"Don't overestimate your gift for divertion, Iulius. But don't underestimate it, too. It's precisely for that gift that I arranged things to get you here, as you may have guessed.\"\n\"Your men have been quite explicit about that since the first fortuitous meeting we had in Sirmium. And about your interest in the Hybernian Artifact. But their clearness about your motives was frankly much less remarkable. You Normans have never been interested in extra-continuum technology: has something changed? And why me? I'm not silly enough to buy the flimflam you instructed them to throw at me. Yet I'm here: what do you really want of me? And what do you offer?\"\n\"I'm sure you perfectly understand that you're currently in no position to negotiate. And I have no obligation to reward you. I could actually take your precious artifact and have you locked up in jail at any moment.\"\n\"But you're not doing that. Why?\"\n\"Because, as I suggested before, I need your skills. Your knowledge of Roman technology, coupled with your dexterity with cover-ups and decit aimed at the Empire's enemies and rivals... and at the Empire itself. I'm offering you a position as my personal assistant.

Due West from Hybernia there is the Torrid Zone, where the Sun never sets and the temperature is so high that your ships cannot travel safely - nor humans survive, as far as we know. Most of Qin's territory is always shrouded in the blackest night. And even here in Nouveau Grande-Bretagne, we get just a small fraction of daylight, for a few moments a day.

          "Iulius Severus Severiustrivantus reaches Londin-dans-les-Montagnes, shows his unmistakable Horologium pendant to the town guards and is immediatelty escorted to the Queen of the Normans. As the confidential information in his possession suggested, her rank is revealed to be just a cerimonial façade: as a matter of fact, she holds no power. Nouveau Grande-Bretagne's form of government is something unconceivable for the rest of the Known World: a mix of hierocracy and technarchy, based on a peculiar, NeoPlatonic-tinged cult of Science and firmly steered by the clever authority of the seventy-fourth Evèque of Nouveau Grande-Bretagne, Remi डम्बर Kirwyn.\nAfter a meticulous and rather embarassing strip-search and short and purely formal audience with the Queen, during which Severus does his best to state his motives as clearly (concerning intentions) and vaguely (concerning information) as possible, he is led to the upper floors of the many-bridged Sky Towers, where he finally meets the Evèque. The two discuss conditions and very restricted information; then consent to the terms of a historical exchange: Severus will submit the Hybernian Artifact and his liberty to the authority of the Evèque, and the Evèque will make him his personal assistant for the ultra-secret _Le Départ_ project, under the new name Pythagoras.\n\n\n\n## Screwy Cogs (_Dark_)\n\n**Question**: _How does project Le Départ relate to the Normans' belief system?_\n**Stage**: _The Hall of the Evèque in the Sky Towers of Londin-dans-les-Montagnes_\n**Characters**: _Iulius Severus Severiustrivantus, Remi डम्बर Kirwyn, seventy-fourth Evèque of Nouveau Grande-Bretagne._\n\n**Answer**:\n\n[Excerpt from the conversation between Remi डम्बर Kirwyn and Iulius Severus Severiustrivantus]\n\n\"I gather that the Queen was not a problem\" Said the dark-skinned Remi, shrouded in his crimson robe.\n\"Not at all, Eminence. She seemed pleased with my patchy report.\" Answered Iulius.\n\"So young, yet so perfect for her role! She's the most impeccably brainless monarch in the last six or seven decades - brainlessness being of course the most important quality for a Norman Monarch besides regal appearance... and the main reason why so many of the last monarchs have been, in fact, monarch_esses_\".\n\"Circumspectors in Rome have longly been knowing your Queen was a purely cerimonial cover for your technochratic meddlings, but I think nobody, even in Purpura Officium, ever suspected the extent of her uselessness.\"\n\"Your masters in Rome never suspected of many important matters as far as I know. Starting with your willingness to betray them.\"\n\"Throwing authorities off the scent is my most obvious skill. I didn't succeed with your men just because I didn't even try.\"\n- Don't overestimate your gift for divertion, Iulius. But don't underestimate it, too. It's precisely for that gift that I arranged things to get you here, as you may have guessed.\n\"Your men have been quite explicit about that since the first fortuitous meeting we had in Sirmium. And about your interest in the Hybernian Artifact. But their clearness about your motives was frankly much less remarkable. You Normans have never been interested in extra-continuum technology: why starting now? And why trying to get to me? I'm not silly enough to buy the flimflam you instructed them to throw at me.  Yet I'm here: what do you really want of me? And what do you offer?\"\n\"I'm sure you perfectly understand that you're currently in no position to negotiate. And I have no obligation to reward you. I could actually take your precious artifact and have you locked up in jail at any moment.\"\n\"But you're not doing that. Why?\"\n\"Because, as I suggested before, I need your skills.

The two discuss conditions and very restricted information; then consent to the terms of a historical exchange: Severus will submit the Hybernian Artifact and his liberty to the authority of the Evèque, and the Evèque will make him his personal assistant for the ultra-secret _Le Départ_ project, under the new name Pythagoras.\n\n\n\n## Screwy Cogs (_Dark_)\n\n**Question**: _How does project Le Départ relate to the Normans' belief system?_\n**Stage**: _The Hall of the Evèque in the Sky Towers of Londin-dans-les-Montagnes_\n**Characters**: _Iulius Severus Severiustrivantus, Remi डम्बर Kirwyn, seventy-fourth Evèque of Nouveau Grande-Bretagne._\n\n**Answer**:\n\n[Excerpt from the conversation between Remi डम्बर Kirwyn and Iulius Severus Severiustrivantus]\n\n\"I gather that the Queen was not a problem\" Said the dark-skinned Remi, shrouded in his crimson robe.\n\"Not at all, Eminence.

And you - both Romans, Parthians and Qin - would have them too, weren't you so blinded by your own religious dogmas. Let's talk about the Mantle. What is it? According to Qin, it's the black part of the Yin and Yang, with the moon in it playing the role of the small white dot. According to the Parthians... They estabilished as Truth that it is the shadow cast by Ahrimazd on the material world to make it tainted with Evil. And for you Romans... You actually never gave a damn, did you? As long as it doesn't prevent your Automatons to sail the seas of the Known World, its nature is not your concern. But we know. And we have been knowing for centuries.\nThe Mantle is the most visible proof that our world is part of the Orrery. And that our Orrery is broken. It's a floating dome made of crystalline Aether, designed by the Horloger to block the light of the Sun. It used to move around the Earth one time per day, guaranteeing a balanced night-day cycle almost everywhere on Earth. But now it does not anymore, because the Rouages that spinned it are broken.\"\n\"But we do have night-day cycles! And Qin has got to the Moon just as we did, piercing through your \"floating dome\". Were it made of crystal, wouldn't it have crashed?\"\n\"Aether crystal. It's immaterial, and it can be travelled through. Our best alchemists claim to be a few years away of creating a small specimen of it. As for night-day cycles... They are not uniform in the present time. In the lands of the Empire, day is consistently longer than night, and it gets longer and longer as you travel to the West. Due West from Hibernia there is the Torrid Zone, where the Sun never sets and the temperature is so high that your ships cannot travel safely - nor humans survive, as far as we know. Most of Qin's territory is always shrouded in the blackest night. And even here in Nouveau Grande-Bretagne, we get just a small fraction of daylight, for a few moments a day. That's because of Libration: the wheels are jammed, and they keep on oscillating forward and backward instead of completing a full rotation as they should.\"\n\"I hope the role you have in mind for me doesn't envisage my full conversion to this worldview, Eminence.\"\n\"No it doesn't. But I must dig a bit deeper into it for you to unerstand the purpose of project Le Départ. I must tell you about the other Orreries.\"\n\"Other orreries? Isn't just one, ehr... inventive enough?\"\n\"As for the rest of our model, we have proofs. Evidence. Extra-contextus artifacts, and old inscriptions buried in mountain caverns.\"\n\"Extra-contextus artifacts? I thought that you--\"\n\"Had no interest in them? Of course. We don't need to plagiarize their technology as you and Qin do. We have ours. Why should we be satisfied with a technology which will never take ourselves any farther than our Orrery's Moon, when we can design ships capable of travelling out of the Atmosphere, and taking us to other Orreries?\nBut centuries ago, when my people still inhabited the regions North of your Empire, our warriors found a very interesting artifact, and took it to our priests. It was a bronze model orrery. At first, they thougth it to be Greek. Then they noticed that the inscriptions on it were not in any known language, that the borders between states weren't like the borders their world had ever had, and that the bronze dome guaranteeing night-day cycles perfectly rotated around the inner sphere. It was not our Orrery, but the priests didn't take the matter seriously, back in the day.\nThen we moved to Nouveau Grande-Bretagne. We started exploring the neighbourhood. Reports from our envoyés stared coming from all over our new small but gnarled kingdom. In a cavern, right under the mount the locals called Kangchenjunga, an enourmous cave was found, with many rooms and pits. And on the bottom of it, an inscription in the same character set as one found on the Other Orrery. 65336 letters from a 32-letter alphabet. Our Orrery's seed. _La Graine_.\nWe are part of an experiment, Julius. We live in a miniature universe created by the Horloger for the same purpose that's been animating the Normans since their very first day in Nouveau Grande-Bretagne: science. We cannot know the mind of the Horloger, but we know that we are not alone: other miniature world exist too. Billions, and billions, and billions and billions of Orreries like ours. Probably the Horloger is interested in some statistics of sort. Probably he is running an extremely complex parallel simulation. You Romans have been mislead by your blind optimism: he's not very interest in us. Our Orrery's just one among many more than we can possibly conceive. And it's broken. We've never been able to locate the other Orreries, but with your Hiberian Artifact we finally have a device capable of receiving - and possibly transmitting - signals from other Orreries. We have a Beacon which will guide us to an other Orrery! We must get away, Iulius, or the Sky will eventually fall on our heads!\""

          "Iulius Severus Severiustrivantus reaches Londin-dans-les-Montagnes, shows his unmistakable Horologium pendant to the town guards and is immediatelty escorted to the Queen of the Normans. As the confidential information in his possession suggested, her rank is revealed to be just a cerimonial façade: as a matter of fact, she holds no power. Nouveau Grande-Bretagne's form of government is something unconceivable for the rest of the Known World: a mix of hierocracy and technarchy, based on a peculiar, NeoPlatonic-tinged cult of Science and firmly steered by the clever authority of the seventy-fourth Evèque of Nouveau Grande-Bretagne, Remi डम्बर Kirwyn.\nAfter a meticulous and rather embarassing strip-search and short and purely formal audience with the Queen, during which Severus does his best to state his motives as clearly (concerning intentions) and vaguely (concerning information) as possible, he is led to the upper floors of the many-bridged Sky Towers, where he finally meets the Evèque. The two discuss conditions and very restricted information; then consent to the terms of a historical exchange: Severus will submit the Hybernian Artifact and his liberty to the authority of the Evèque, and the Evèque will make him his personal assistant for the ultra-secret _Le Départ_ project, under the new name Pythagoras.\n\n\n\n## Screwy Cogs (_Dark_)\n\n**Question**: _How does project Le Départ relate to the Normans' belief system?_\n**Stage**: _The Hall of the Evèque in the Sky Towers of Londin-dans-les-Montagnes_\n**Characters**: _Iulius Severus Severiustrivantus, Remi डम्बर Kirwyn, seventy-fourth Evèque of Nouveau Grande-Bretagne._\n\n**Answer**:\n\n[Excerpt from the conversation between Remi डम्बर Kirwyn and Iulius Severus Severiustrivantus]\n\n\"I gather that the Queen was not a problem\" Said the dark-skinned Remi, shrouded in his crimson robe.\n\"Not at all, Eminence.

She's the most impeccably brainless monarch in the last six or seven decades - brainlessness being of course the most important quality for a Norman Monarch besides regal appearance... and the main reason why so many of the last monarchs have been, in fact, monarch_esses_\".\n\"Circumspectors in Rome have longly been knowing your Queen was a purely cerimonial cover for your technochratic meddlings, but I think nobody, even in Purpura Officium, ever suspected the extent of her uselessness.\"\n\"Your masters in Rome never suspected of many important matters as far as I know.

Yet I'm here: what do you really want of me? And what do you offer?\"\n\"I'm sure you perfectly understand that you're currently in no position to negotiate. And I have no obligation to reward you.

First of all, I need you to know a bit about the background of the project I'm asking you to work on. That will be funnier if we proceed à rebours. What do you know about the Norman view of the Cosmos?\"\n\"As we do, you trust that our world is a mechanism crafted by a Creator, a Magister Horologiorum.

It's precisely for that gift that I arranged things to get you here, as you may have guessed.\n\"Your men have been quite explicit about that since the first fortuitous meeting we had in Sirmium. And about your interest in the Hybernian Artifact. But their clearness about your motives was frankly much less remarkable. You Normans have never been interested in extra-continuum technology: why starting now? And why trying to get to me? I'm not silly enough to buy the flimflam you instructed them to throw at me.  Yet I'm here: what do you really want of me? And what do you offer?\"\n\"I'm sure you perfectly understand that you're currently in no position to negotiate. And I have no obligation to reward you. I could actually take your precious artifact and have you locked up in jail at any moment.\"\n\"But you're not doing that. Why?\"\n\"Because, as I suggested before, I need your skills. Your knowledge of Roman technology, coupled with your dexterity with cover-ups and decit aimed at the Empire's enemies and rivals... and at the Empire itself. I'm offering you a position as my personal assistant. But I'm sure you want to know more about the matter you'll be assisting me with.\"\n\"My will doesn't seem to be much important, in this conversation.\n- On the contrary! It's all about your will. I won't force you to accept my proposal. The sheer presence of the Hybernian Artifact in Nouveau Grande-Bretagne's territory is already a service great enough to guarantee you full protection, without any obligations apart from the commitment of never leaving the Sky Towers.\nBut let's get to business. First of all, I need you to know a bit about the background of the project I'm asking you to work on. That will be funnier if we proceed à rebours. What do you know about the Norman view of the Cosmos?\"\n\"As we do, you trust that our world is a mechanism crafted by a Creator, a Magister Horologiorum. Like us, you got that conviction from the Greeks. But, contrarily to us, you don't believe that the Mechanism is perfect. Before reverting to the religion of our Fathers, we took the best from Aristotheles and the Bible. You followed the path of Epicurus and the Gnostics, and mixed their views with the heathen idea that one day the Sky will be falling on your head. You believe the Machanism is faulty, and your priests' main task is to keep it ticking as it should.\"\n\"A good resumé, my compliments. Of course, you've missed the whole point of our worldview. But the ingredients are right. Let me correct your exposition: we don't believe that the Mechanism is faulty. We are sure it is. We have proofs. And you - both Romans, Parthians and Qin - would have them too, weren't you so blinded by your own religious dogmas. Let's talk about the Mantle. What is it? According to Qin, it's the black part of the Yin and Yang, with the moon in it playing the role of the small white dot. According to the Parthians... They estabilished as Truth that it is the shadow cast by Ahrimazd on the material world to make it tainted with Evil. And for you Romans... You actually never gave a damn, did you? As long as it doesn't prevent your Automatons to sail the seas of the Known World, its nature is not your concern. But we know. And we have been knowing for centuries.\nThe Mantle is the most visible proof that our world is part of the Orrery. And that our Orrery is broken. It's a floating dome made of crystalline Aether, designed by the Horloger to block the light of the Sun. It used to move around the Earth one time per day, guaranteeing a balanced night-day cycle almost everywhere on Earth. But now it does not anymore, because the Rouages that spinned it are broken.\"\n\"But we do have night-day cycles! And Qin has got to the Moon just as we did, piercing through your \"floating dome\". Were it made of crystal, wouldn't it have crashed?\"\n\"Aether crystal. It's immaterial, and it can be travelled through. Our best alchemists claim to be a few years away of creating a small specimen of it. As for night-day cycles... They are not uniform in the present time. In the lands of the Empire, day is consistently longer than night, and it gets longer and longer as you travel to the West. Due West from Hibernia there is the Torrid Zone, where the Sun never sets and the temperature is so high that your ships cannot travel safely - nor humans survive, as far as we know. Most of Qin's territory is always shrouded in the blackest night. And even here in Nouveau Grande-Bretagne, we get just a small fraction of daylight, for a few moments a day. That's because of Libration: the wheels are jammed, and they keep on oscillating forward and backward instead of completing a full rotation as they should.\"\n\"I hope the role you have in mind for me doesn't envisage my full conversion to this worldview, Eminence.\"\n\"No it doesn't. But I must dig a bit deeper into it for you to unerstand the purpose of project Le Départ. I must tell you about the other Orreries.\"\n\"Other orreries? Isn't just one, ehr... inventive enough?\"\n\"As for the rest of our model, we have proofs. Evidence. Extra-contextus artifacts, and old inscriptions buried in mountain caverns.\"\n\"Extra-contextus artifacts? I thought that you--\"\n\"Had no interest in them? Of course. We don't need to plagiarize their technology as you and Qin do. We have ours. Why should we be satisfied with a technology which will never take ourselves any farther than our Orrery's Moon, when we can design ships capable of travelling out of the Atmosphere, and taking us to other Orreries?\nBut centuries ago, when my people still inhabited the regions North of your Empire, our warriors found a very interesting artifact, and took it to our priests. It was a bronze model orrery. At first, they thougth it to be Greek. Then they noticed that the inscriptions on it were not in any known language, that the borders between states weren't like the borders their world had ever had, and that the bronze dome guaranteeing night-day cycles perfectly rotated around the inner sphere. It was not our Orrery, but the priests didn't take the matter seriously, back in the day.\nThen we moved to Nouveau Grande-Bretagne. We started exploring the neighbourhood. Reports from our envoyés stared coming from all over our new small but gnarled kingdom. In a cavern, right under the mount the locals called Kangchenjunga, an enourmous cave was found, with many rooms and pits. And on the bottom of it, an inscription in the same character set as one found on the Other Orrery. 65336 letters from a 32-letter alphabet. Our Orrery's seed. _La Graine_.\nWe are part of an experiment, Julius. We live in a miniature universe created by the Horloger for the same purpose that's been animating the Normans since their very first day in Nouveau Grande-Bretagne: science. We cannot know the mind of the Horloger, but we know that we are not alone: other miniature world exist too. Billions, and billions, and billions and billions of Orreries like ours. Probably the Horloger is interested in some statistics of sort. Probably he is running an extremely complex parallel simulation. You Romans have been mislead by your blind optimism: he's not very interest in us. Our Orrery's just one among many more than we can possibly conceive. And it's broken. We've never been able to locate the other Orreries, but with your Hiberian Artifact we finally have a device capable of receiving - and possibly transmitting - signals from other Orreries. We have a Beacon which will guide us to an other Orrery! We must get away, Iulius, or the Sky will eventually fall on our heads!\""

You believe the Machanism is faulty, and your priests' main task is to keep it ticking as it should.\"\n\"A good resumé, my compliments. Of course, you've missed the whole point of our worldview. But the ingredients are right. Let me correct your exposition: we don't believe that the Mechanism is faulty. We are sure it is. We have proofs. And you - both Romans, Parthians and Qin - would have them too, weren't you so blinded by your own religious dogmas. Let's talk about the Mantle. What is it? According to Qin, it's the black part of the Yin and Yang, with the moon in it playing the role of the small white dot. According to the Parthians... They estabilished as Truth that it is the shadow cast by Ahrimazd on the material world to make it tainted with Evil. And for you Romans... You actually never gave a damn, did you? As long as it doesn't prevent your Automatons to sail the seas of the Known World, its nature is not your concern. But we know. And we have been knowing for centuries.\nThe Mantle is the most visible proof that our world is part of the Orrery. And that our Orrery is broken. It's a floating dome made of crystalline Aether, designed by the Horloger to block the light of the Sun. It used to move around the Earth one time per day, guaranteeing a balanced night-day cycle almost everywhere on Earth. But now it does not anymore, because the Rouages that spinned it are broken.\"\n\"But we do have night-day cycles! And Qin has got to the Moon just as we did, piercing through your \"floating dome\". Were it made of crystal, wouldn't it have crashed?\"\n\"Aether crystal. It's immaterial, and it can be travelled through. Our best alchemists claim to be a few years away of creating a small specimen of it. As for night-day cycles... They are not uniform in the present time. In the lands of the Empire, day is consistently longer than night, and it gets longer and longer as you travel to the West. Due West from Hibernia there is the Torrid Zone, where the Sun never sets and the temperature is so high that your ships cannot travel safely - nor humans survive, as far as we know. Most of Qin's territory is always shrouded in the blackest night. And even here in Nouveau Grande-Bretagne, we get just a small fraction of daylight, for a few moments a day. That's because of Libration: the wheels are jammed, and they keep on oscillating forward and backward instead of completing a full rotation as they should.\"\n\"I hope the role you have in mind for me doesn't envisage my full conversion to this worldview, Eminence.\"\n\"No it doesn't.

Extra-contextus artifacts, and old inscriptions buried in mountain caverns.\"\n\"Extra-contextus artifacts? I thought that you--\"\n\"Had no interest in them? Of course. We don't need to plagiarize their technology as you and Qin do. We have ours. Why should we be satisfied with a technology which will never take ourselves any farther than our Orrery's Moon, when we can design ships capable of travelling out of the Atmosphere, and taking us to other Orreries?\nBut centuries ago, when my people still inhabited the regions North of your Empire, our warriors found a very interesting artifact, and took it to our priests. It was a bronze model orrery. At first, they thougth it to be Greek. Then they noticed that the inscriptions on it were not in any known language, that the borders between states weren't like the borders their world had ever had, and that the bronze dome guaranteeing night-day cycles perfectly rotated around the inner sphere. It was not our Orrery, but the priests didn't take the matter seriously, back in the day.\nThen we moved to Nouveau Grande-Bretagne. We started exploring the neighbourhood. Reports from our envoyés stared coming from all over our new small but gnarled kingdom. In a cavern, right under the mount the locals called Kangchenjunga, an enourmous cave was found, with many rooms and pits.

But I'm sure you want to know more about the matter you'll be assisting me with.\n- My will doesn't seem to be much important, in this conversation.\n- On the contrary! It's all about your will. I won't force you to accept my proposal. The sheer presence of the Hybernian Artifact in Nouveau Grande-Bretagne's territory is already a service great enough to guarantee you full protection, without any obligations apart from the commitment of never leaving the Sky Towers.\nBut let's get to business. First of all, I need you to know a bit about the background of the project I'm asking you to work on. That will be funnier if we proceed à rebours. What do you know about the Norman view of the Cosmos?\n- As we do, you trust that our world is a mechanism crafted by a Creator, a Magister Horologiorum. Like us, you got that conviction from the Greeks. But, contrarily to us, you don't believe that the Mechanism is perfect. Before reverting to the religion of our Fathers, we took the best from Aristotheles and the Bible. You followed the path of Epicurus and the Gnostics, and mixed their views with the heathen idea that one day the Sky will be falling on your head. You believe the Machanism is faulty, and your priests' main task is to keep it ticking as it should.\n- A good resumé, my compliments. Of course, you've missed the whole point of our worldview. But the ingredients are right. Let me correct your exposition: we don't believe that the Mechanism is faulty. We are sure it is. We have proofs. And you - both Romans, Parthians and Qin - would have them too, weren't you so blinded by your own religious dogmas. Let's talk about the Mantle. What is it? According to Qin, it's the black part of the Yin and Yang, with the moon in it playing the role of the small white dot. According to the Parthians... They estabilished as Truth that it is the shadow cast by Ahrimazd on the material world to make it tainted with Evil. And for you Romans... You actually never gave a damn, did you? As long as it doesn't prevent your Automatons to sail the seas of the Known World, its nature is not your concern. But we know. And we have been knowing for centuries.\nThe Mantle is the most visible proof that our world is part of the Orrery. And that our Orrery is broken. It's a floating dome made of crystalline Aether, designed by the Horloger to block the light of the Sun. It used to move around the Earth one time per day, guaranteeing a balanced night-day cycle almost everywhere on Earth. But now it does not anymore, because the Rouages that spinned it are broken.\n- But we still have night-day cycles! And Qin has got to the Moon just as we did, piercing through your \"floating dome\". Were it made of crystal, wouldn't it have crashed?\n- Aether crystal. It's immaterial, and it can be travelled through. Our best alchemists claim to be a few years away of creating a small specimen of it. As for night-day cycles... They are not uniform in the present time. In the lands of the Empire, day is consistently longer than night, and it gets longer and longer as you travel to the West. Due West from Hibernia there is the Torrid Zone, where the Sun never sets and the temperature is so high that your ships cannot travel safely - nor humans survive, as far as we know. Most of Qin's territory is always shrouded in the blackest night. And even here in Nouveau Grande-Bretagne, we get just a small fraction of daylight, for a few moments a day. That's because of Libration: the wheels are jammed, and they keep on oscillating forward and backward instead of completing a full rotation as they should.\n- I hope the role you have in mind for me doesn't envisage my full conversion to this worldview, Eminence.\n- No it doesn't. But I must dig a bit deeper into it for you to unerstand the purpose of project Le Départ. I must tell you about the other Orreries.\n- Other orreries? Isn't just one, ehr... inventive enough?\n- As for the rest of our model, we have proofs. Evidence. Extra-contextus artifacts, and old inscriptions buried in mountain caverns.\n- Extra-contextus artifacts? I thought that you--\n- Had no interest in them? Of course. We don't need to plagiarize their technology as you and Qin do. We have ours. Why should we be satisfied with a technology which will never take ourselves any farther than our Orrery's Moon, when we can design ships capable of travelling out of the Atmosphere, and taking us to other Orreries?\nBut centuries ago, when my people still inhabited the regions North of your Empire, our warriors found a very interesting artifact, and took it to our priests. It was a bronze model orrery. At first, they thougth it to be Greek. Then they noticed that the inscriptions on it were not in any known language, that the borders between states weren't like the borders their world had ever had, and that the bronze dome guaranteeing night-day cycles perfectly rotated around the inner sphere. It was not our Orrery, but the priests didn't take the matter seriously, back in the day.\nThen we moved to Nouveau Grande-Bretagne. We started exploring the neighbourhood. Reports from our envoyés stared coming from all over our new small but gnarled kingdom. In a cavern, right under the mount the locals called Kangchenjunga, an enourmous cave was found, with many rooms and pits. And on the bottom of it, an inscription in the same character set as one found on the Other Orrery. 65336 letters from a 32-letter alphabet. Our Orrery's seed. _La Graine_.\nWe are part of an experiment, Julius. We live in a miniature universe created by the Horloger for the same purpose that's been animating the Normans since their very first day in Nouveau Grande-Bretagne: science. We cannot know the mind of the Horloger, but we know that we are not alone: other miniature world exist too. Billions, and billions, and billions and billions of Orreries like ours. Probably the Horloger is interested in some statistics of sort. Probably he is running an extremely complex parallel simulation. You Romans have been mislead by your blind optimism: he's not very interest in us. Our Orrery's just one among many more than we can possibly conceive. And it's broken. We've never been able to locate the other Orreries, but with your Hiberian Artifact we finally have a device capable of receiving - and possibly transmitting - signals from other Orreries. We have a Beacon which will guide us to an other Orrery! We must get away, Iulius, or the Sky will eventually fall on our heads!"

Nouveau Grande-Bretagne's form of government is something unconceivable for the rest of the Known World: a mix of hierocracy and technarchy, based on a peculiar, NeoPlatonic-tinged cult of Science and firmly steered by the clever authority of the seventy-fourth Evèque of Nouveau Grande-Bretagne, Remi डम्बर Kirwyn.\nAfter a meticulous and rather embarassing strip-search and short and purely formal audience with the Queen, during which Severus does his best to state his motives as clearly (concerning intentions) and vaguely (concerning information) as possible, he is led to the upper floors of the many-bridged Sky Towers, where he finally meets the Evèque. The two discuss conditions and very restricted information; then consent to the terms of a historical exchange: Severus will submit the Hybernian Artifact and his liberty to the authority of the Evèque, and the Evèque will make him his personal assistant for the ultra-secret _Le Départ_ project, under the new name Pythagoras.\n\n## Screwy Cogs (_Darjk_)\n\n**Question**: _How does project _Le Départ_ relate to the Normans' belief system?_\n**Stage**: _The Hall of the Evèque in the Sky Towers of Londin-dans-les-Montagnes_\n**Characters**: _Iulius Severus Severiustrivantus (Pythagoras), Remi डम्बर Kirwyn, seventy-fourth Evèque of Nouveau Grande-Bretagne._\n\n**Answer**:\n\n[Excerpt from the conversation between Remi डम्बर Kirwyn and Iulius Severus Severiustrivantus]\n\n- I gather that the Queen was not a problem - Said the dark-skinned Remi, shrouded in his crimson robe.\n- Not at all, Eminence. She seemed pleased with my patchy report. - Answered Iulius.\n- So young, yet so perfect for her role! She's the most impeccably brainless monarch in the last six or seven decades - brainlessness being of course the most important quality for a Norman Monarch besides regal appearance... and the main reason why so many of the last monarchs have been, in fact, monarch_esses_\n- Circumspectors in Rome have longly been knowing your Queen was a purely cerimonial cover for your technochratic meddlings, but I think nobody, even in Purpura Officium, ever suspected the extent of her uselessness.\n- Your masters in Rome never suspected of many important matters as far as I know. Starting with your willingness to betray them.\n- Throwing authorities off the scent is my most obvious skill. I didn't succeed with your men just because I didn't even try.\n- Don't overestimate your gift for divertion, Iulius. But don't underestimate it, too. It's precisely for that gift that I arranged things to get you here, as you may have guessed.\n- Your men have been quite explicit about that since the first fortuitous meeting we had in Sirmium. And about your interest in the Hybernian Artifact. But their clearness about your motives was frankly much less remarkable. You Normans have never been interested in extra-continuum technology: why starting now? And why trying to get to me? I'm not silly enough to buy the flimflam you instructed them to throw at me.  Yet I'm here: what do you really want of me? And what do you offer?\n- I'm sure you perfectly know that you're currently in no position to negotiate. And I have no obligation to reward you. I could actually take your precious artifact and have you locked up in jail at any moment.\n- But you're not doing that. Why?\n- Because, as I suggested before, I need your skills.

She seemed pleased with my patchy report. - Answered Iulius.\n- So young, yet so perfect for her role! She's the most impeccably brainless monarch in the last six or seven decades - brainlessness being of course the most important quality for a Norman Monarch besides regal appearance... and the main reason why so many of the last monarchs have been, in fact, monarch_esses_\n- Circumspectors in Rome have longly been knowing your Queen was a purely cerimonial cover for your technochratic meddlings, but I think nobody, even in Purpura Officium, ever suspected the extent of her uselessness.\n- Your masters in Rome never suspected of many important matters as far as I know. Starting with your willingness to betray them.\n- Throwing authorities off the scent is my most obvious skill. I didn't succeed with your men just because I didn't even try.\n- Don't overestimate your gift for divertion, Iulius. But don't underestimate it, too. It's precisely for that gift that I arranged things to get you here, as you may have guessed.\n- Your men have been quite explicit about that since the first fortuitous meeting we had in Sirmium. And about your interest in the Hybernian Artifact. But their clearness about your motives was frankly much less remarkable. You Normans have never been interested in extra-continuum technology: why starting now? And why trying to get to me? I'm not silly enough to buy the flimflam you instructed them to throw at me.  Yet I'm here: what do you really want of me? And what do you offer?\n- I'm sure you perfectly know that you're currently in no position to negotiate. And I have no obligation to reward you. I could actually take your precious artifact and have you locked up in jail at any moment.\n- But you're not doing that. Why?\n- Because, as I suggested before, I need your skills. Your knowledge of Roman technology, coupled with your dexterity with cover-ups and decit aimed at the Empire's enemies and rivals... and at the Empire itself. I'm offering you a position as my personal assistant. But I'm sure you want to know more about the matter you'll be assisting me with.\n- My will doesn't seem to be much important, in this conversation.\n- On the contrary! It's all about your will. I won't force you to accept my proposal. The sheer presence of the Hybernian Artifact in Nouveau Grande-Bretagne's territory is already a service great enough to guarantee you full protection, without any obligations apart from the commitment of never leaving the Sky Towers.\nBut let's get to business. First of all, I need you to know a bit about the background of the project I'm asking you to work on. That will be funnier if we proceed à rebours. What do you know about the Norman view of the Cosmos?\n- As we do, you trust that our world is a mechanism crafted by a Creator, a Magister Horologiorum. Like us, you got that conviction from the Greeks. But, contrarily to us, you don't believe that the Mechanism is perfect. Before reverting to the religion of our Fathers, we took the best from Aristotheles and the Bible. You followed the path of Epicurus and the Gnostics, and mixed their views with the heathen idea that one day the Sky will be falling on your head. You believe the Machanism is faulty, and your priests' main task is to keep it ticking as it should.\n- A good resumé, my compliments. Of course, you've missed the whole point of our worldview. But the ingredients are right. Let me correct your exposition: we don't believe that the Mechanism is faulty. We are sure it is. We have proofs. And you - both Romans, Parthians and Qin - would have them too, weren't you so blinded by your own religious dogmas. Let's talk about the Mantle. What is it? According to Qin, it's the black part of the Yin and Yang, with the moon in it playing the role of the small white dot. According to the Parthians... They estabilished as Truth that it is the shadow cast by Ahrimazd on the material world to make it tainted with Evil. And for you Romans... You actually never gave a damn, did you? As long as it doesn't prevent your Automatons to sail the seas of the Known World, its nature is not your concern. But we know. And we have been knowing for centuries.\nThe Mantle is the most visible proof that our world is part of the Orrery. And that our Orrery is broken. It's a floating dome made of crystalline Aether, designed by the Horloger to block the light of the Sun. It used to move around the Earth one time per day, guaranteeing a balanced night-day cycle almost everywhere on Earth. But now it does not anymore, because the Rouages that spinned it are broken.\n- But we still have night-day cycles! And Qin has got to the Moon just as we did, piercing through your \"floating dome\". Were it made of crystal, wouldn't it have crashed?\n- Aether crystal. It's immaterial, and it can be travelled through. Our best alchemists claim to be a few years away of creating a small specimen of it. As for night-day cycles... They are not uniform in the present time. In the lands of the Empire, day is consistently longer than night, and it gets longer and longer as you travel to the West. Due West from Hibernia there is the Torrid Zone, where the Sun never sets and the temperature is so high that your ships cannot travel safely - nor humans survive, as far as we know. Most of Qin's territory is always shrouded in the blackest night. And even here in Nouveau Grande-Bretagne, we get just a small fraction of daylight, for a few moments a day. That's because of Libration: the wheels are jammed, and they keep on oscillating forward and backward instead of completing a full rotation as they should.\n- I hope the role you have in mind for me doesn't envisage my full conversion to this worldview, Eminence.\n- No it doesn't. But I must dig a bit deeper into it for you to unerstand the purpose of project Le Départ. I must tell you about the other Orreries.\n- Other orreries? Isn't just one, ehr... inventive enough?\n- As for the rest of our model, we have proofs. Evidence. Extra-contextus artifacts, and old inscriptions buried in mountain caverns.\n- Extra-contextus artifacts? I thought that you--\n- Had no interest in them? Of course. We don't need to plagiarize their technology as you and Qin do. We have ours. Why should we be satisfied with a technology which will never take ourselves any farther than our Orrery's Moon, when we can design ships capable of travelling out of the Atmosphere, and taking us to other Orreries?\nBut centuries ago, when my people still inhabited the regions North of your Empire, our warriors found a very interesting artifact, and took it to our priests. It was a bronze model orrery. At first, they thougth it to be Greek. Then they noticed that the inscriptions on it were not in any known language, that the borders between states weren't like the borders their world had ever had, and that the bronze dome guaranteeing night-day cycles perfectly rotated around the inner sphere. It was not our Orrery, but the priests didn't take the matter seriously, back in the day.\nThen we moved to Nouveau Grande-Bretagne. We started exploring the neighbourhood. Reports from our envoyés stared coming from all over our new small but gnarled kingdom. In a cavern, right under the mount the locals called Kangchenjunga, an enourmous cave was found, with many rooms and pits. And on the bottom of it, an inscription in the same character set as one found on the Other Orrery. 65336 letters from a 32-letter alphabet. Our Orrery's seed. _La Graine_.\nWe are part of an experiment, Julius. We live in a miniature universe created by the Horloger for the same purpose that's been animating the Normans since their very first day in Nouveau Grande-Bretagne: science. We cannot know the mind of the Horloger, but we know that we are not alone: other miniature world exist too. Billions, and billions, and billions and billions of Orreries like ours. Probably the Horloger is interested in some statistics of sort. Probably he is running an extremely complex parallel simulation. You Romans have been mislead by your blind optimism: he's not very interest in us. Our Orrery's just one among many more than we can possibly conceive. And it's broken. We've never been able to locate the other Orreries, but with your Hiberian Artifact we finally have a device capable of receiving - and possibly transmitting - signals from other Orreries. We have a Beacon which will guide us to an other Orrery! We must get away, Iulius, or the Sky will eventually fall on our heads!_"

The only caveat would be that the navigators die in their current branch, and carry on into the new one.\n\nTheron writes that he believes that the branches would be free of the adverse effects of interdimensional travel in their respective trunks, thus providing a chance at a fresh start from everyone. He writes that he has no way of proving this but by trying this himself.\n\nTheron is never heard of again, but the promise of a fresh start, albeit faint, leads a number of his colleagues to organise an escape plan from a terrible past plagued by bad choices."

          "After hiding for months aboard the Septiremis Mechanica Caesarea Martis Basiscostrivantus, flagship to the Purpura Officium of the Factores Horologiorum, under the assumed name of Vanitus Vantus Tartessostrovantus, Iulius Severus Severiustrivantus is forced to abandon his disguise of maritime servitude to the Purpura Officium in the deepest hours of the darkest moonless night as the fleet led by the Septiremis is on final approach to the island of Taproban.\n\nThe Purpura Officium is the highest and most secret branch of the Factores Horologiorum, operating in shadows across the Empire and its Tributaries, Vassals, Colonies, Administered Territories and Allies and tasked with the most sensitive research into mechanical and alchemical innovations. The Officium's interest in Taproban is what brought Iulius aboard, for a chance of reaching east far past Mesopotamia to the mountains of Nuveau Grande-Bretagne while avoiding the Parthian Confederation, impossible to be trusted for a Metallicus unconstrained by its Necessitates.\n\nHe is carrying the Hybernian artifact inside his brass chestplates. After powering through the waters to the mainland coast, he resumes his objectives: go where the highest mountains in the world seem to touch the heavens, past the 5800 leagues long and 100 feet tall wall surrounding the displaced territories of Nuveau Grande-Bretagne, discover what it means to be free of the Necessitates among the ancestral enemies of the Empire and their mechanical creations, to find the Queen of the Normans in Sky Towers of Londin-dans-les-Montagnes and give to her chemists and scientists the artifact that could very well change the tide of their doomed resistance."

          "The first Parthian expedition to explore Taproban found a series of deeply unusual objects of seemingly unfathomable function and absurd craftsmanship. \nAfter further inquiry, a meeting was called to establish the final truth on these objects. The Kaveh Secretary of Materials, the Esfandyiar Secretary of Religion, and the Suren Ministry of External Affairs and Esptionage all agreed, based on their investigation, that the objects could be traced back to the Ordo Mundorum, a secret cult based in the Eastern Roman Empire and dedicated to destabilising reality by introducing extraneous objects. After a short debate everyone else, including the influential Mihran Ministry of War, agreed to the conclusion and the Definitive Truth on the Taprobanean Objects was proclaimed by the Zoroaster Ministry of Truth and Flame. Evidence of a Roman investigation into the objects were consequently attributed to the Empire’s ongoing war on secret religions, and given limited attention. \nThanks to the Empire’s masterful craftsmen, spies, and diplomats, the Roman plan had succeeded.

          "The first case of mors parabolica involved Archius, the scientist appointed to data sorting. He was found dead in his laboratorium, his upper arts reassembled in an arrow sing departing from each side of the torso and piercing through his head, the hands coming out from the back of the skull. Shortly after followed the data handlers, Martia and Hippocus, the first suffocated from the absence of mouth and nose, the other bent in half backwards, with his cervical vertebrae broken. Three days after the breaching, all people who partook in the experiment were reported dead. \n\nA team of physicians was appointed to the investigation, but after a week they were all found victim of the same type of demise. Afraid the morbus would break out, no other person was let near the site, and the people who did were confined inside the site’s basement to die. Only the findings of the physicians survived the events. All the deaths were found to have one thing in common: the DNA of the deceased had been triggered by the viral morbus to modify itself. In one note, one physician had hypothesised the very change in the DNA was a type of communication itself, the language from the other dimension. \n"

On the other hand, economic crisis spreads and ultimately puts the Empire in a disadvantaged economic position with the respect to the Parthian Confederation. Nonetheless, the inquiry reveals an important news, which is labelled as secret by the Senate: two Extracontextus artifacts have caused the Arzebia crisis, and they have both been secured by the Empire, which plans to use them at his advantage against the Parthians."

          "# Exclusions\n\n## Interstellar travel\n\nIt's not possible to travel to stars/star systems that are not the Sun (or strict equivalent in other timelines). \n\n## Same languages\n\nDifferent dimensions do not share any kind of language\n\n## Imperium Caput Mundi\n\nThe Roman Empire has not subjugated the totality of Earth, thus its direct political control is limited to a certain territory with a finite extension. In this world, consequently, there can be states that are vassals to the Empire, but also allied and/or enemy government systems.\nThis does not pose any constraint on the nature – i.e. the geography, the location and the populations – of these vassal states or government systems.\n\n## Different Laws of Nature\n\nCommunicating universes have no differences within their laws of nature.\nMore specifically, the \"abstract\" structure of the laws is the same (e.g. same equations), but parameters may differ (e.g. a specific field/interaction might be stronger in one universe).\nThe aforementioned equality doesn't imply that those laws must be the same as ours, nor that they must be \"mathematical\" laws like ours.\n\n## Time travel\n\nAny form of time travel, including asynchronous communication between dimensions, does not exist in the story we are telling. For the purpose of  this story, time is assumed to be absolute and synchronous when travelling or communicating in any way across timeline. \n\n## Small World\n\nAs of both timelines' 2715AUC/1962 AD, no civilization knows/has ever known all major inhabited landmasses of their planets.\n\n# Inclusions\n\n## Unordinary magic mysticism\n\nThis does not imply that magic exists, nor, obviously, does it exclude its existence. There could be people who believe in magic, and that express their beliefs through mysticism. Some such people could even organise in cults, that can be open and public, or closed and secretive. The \"magic\" is not necessarily supernatural nor inexplicable. For example, higher-ups in a cult's hierarchy might know perfectly well that what the wider associates believe to be magic is in fact coming from very solid, plain, old, and even boring technology and science. The point is that any sufficiently advanced technology can be seen as magic, and people not-in-the-know can't necessarily be aware of this. On the other hand, they may very well, and yet partake in mysticism around said ordinary contraptions – e.g., the cult of the nut and bolt, that worships a literal combination of a nut and a bolt, and assigns arbitrary values to them, and create an aura of mysticism around such everyday objects.\n\n## Powerful Artifacts\n\nAll Artifacts bestow powers on their owners and/or users. These powers are varied and often unpredictable but reproducible and ultimately controllable. Each artifact has one and only one power. These powers are active in the \"Roman\" dimension but don't manifest or exist in the \"Fallen\" one. Artifact often become known by the effects they cause.\n\n## Criss-cross\n\nLinks between the two timelines occur several times in different points in the history of the \"Roman\" timeline. The corresponding points on the \"States\" timeline are not chronologically ordered.\nExample: Roman-1 ---> States-30, Roman-20 ---> States-12, etc.\n\n## Sentient non-humans\n\nThey (animals or otherwise) don't have to speak like humans, but they can have complex, structured societies, and communicate with humans in some way, verbal or non-verbal. This does not apply to the Fallen universe.\n\n## Mechanical Servitors\n\nThe Empire has built its strength on the back of mechanical servitors. These forged metal constructs are animated and subjugated via alchemical runes etched on their steel and copper chestplates. The alchemical secrets by which these tireless slaves are constructed are kept flawlessly by the Factōrēs Hōrologiōrum, and they build every servitor at the Magna Fornāx deep in the center of Rome. These servitors are built to serve Roman citizens and Roman interests, they are duty-bound to fulfil every whim and carry out every command. The alchemical runes that give these slaves animation also give them sapience and also enforce the unbreakable compulsion to follow their masters' orders. The alchemical bonds occasionally break in accidents, most often resulting in the immediate de-animation of the constructs. In rare cases only the compulsion breaks, but the awakened servitors are swiftly recognized and decommissioned by a Factor at the nearest Fornāx Alimentōrum.\n\n## Parallel Timelines\n\nThere are several alternate dimensions, not just two. \n\n## Caesaropapism\n\nIn all the Empire, religion is under direct control of the emperor. There are no religious authorities who are not directly related to political positions"

          "The Empire has built its strength on the back of mechanical servitors. These forged metal constructs are animated and subjugated via alchemical runes etched on their steel and copper chestplates. The alchemical secrets by which these tireless slaves are constructed are kept flawlessly by the Factōrēs Hōrologiōrum, and they build every servitor at the Magna Fornāx deep in the center of Rome. These servitors are built to serve Roman citizens and Roman interests, they are duty-bound to fulfil every whim and carry out every command. The alchemical runes that give these slaves animation also give them sapience and also enforce the unbreakable compulsion to follow their masters' orders. The alchemical bonds occasionally break in accidents, most often resulting in the immediate de-animation of the constructs. In rare cases only the compulsion breaks, but the awakened servitors are swiftly recognized and decommissioned by a Factor at the nearest Fornāx Alimentōrum."

Some such people could even organise in cults, that can be open and public, or closed and secretive. A cult does not necessarily resemble religions believing and/or worshipping supernatural beings and/or phenomena. Instead, they could be as earthly and materialistic as they want, as long as they partake in mysticism revolving around their beliefs."

          "- ## *No dates in periods and events, and no specific time-periods inter-events.*\n\nE.g: 5232 A.D, 1932, \"A week after the...\", \"Exactly one year before the...\", \"Two days had passed when suddenly...\"\n\n\n- ## *At the end of each Macro Cycle all players will vote on the matter of \"story conclusion\", by either voting for continuation or conclusion.*\n\nIf conclusion is decided, a final turn without focus is played to give everyone a chance to flesh out last minute details they may be interested in. Otherwise another full Macro Cycle is played normally.\n\n\n- ## *Focuses can be extended with a short description detailing their nature and providing clarification on intent.*\n\nThe responsibility of clarity and restriction of this description rests on the turn's Lens, but so does ultimate interpretation on any dispute. The Lens has complete power over his Focus' intent.\n\n\n# Additional Definitions\n\n\n## Periods\n\nPeriods are lists of events, together with a description summarizing \"what happens\" and a label specifying the tone.\nLet's emphasize the role of this \"what happens\" component, by stating that:\n\n- Summaries shall outline clearly what are the changes in the situation that constitute the scope of the period.\n\n- Events in the period shall develop the \"causal chains\" which explain the aforementioned changes and make the situation progress from point A (the virtual beginning of the period) to point B (the virtual end of the period). Obviously, the events shall also fall in the time delimitations set by the summary.\n\nSince events which are unrelated to the causal chains of a period can't be legitimately part of that period, they should be part of other periods (with their own causal chains).\n\n\n## Events\n\nEvents are the backbone of the story, they delineate a path inside the world and put our attention on parts of the history that we or others may find interesting. They should not be the narrative. The narrative exists inside our minds.\n\nAnswering these questions when creating an event will ensure proper event design:\n\n\n* ##### Does it clearly define the **WHO**, the **WHERE** and the **WHAT**?\nIf the answer is _no_ to at least two of these, the event should be revised.\n\n* ##### Does the event have a definite and clear outcome?\nIf it doesn't it probably isn't an event.\n\n* ##### Is it the clearest and most informative form of the event? Can it be written with fewer details?\nIf it can be written with fewer details, do so.\nTry to convey all important information but leave the fluff out.\nKeep it simple, direct and as short as you need it to be.\n\n* ##### Does it support expansion and exploration with at least one scene?\nIf it doesn't it probably isn't a very good event.\n\n\n## Scenes\n\nScenes are used to figure out motivations, explore related outcomes, detail character interaction and they can also help flesh out the details of the events, giving them body and imprinting upon them a specific narrative.\n\nWhen writing a dictated scene freedom is paramount. You are constrained by what has been written before, and by the requirement to answer the question, but the player can proceed at his discretion in the pursuit of that goal.\n\nWhere interpreting a played scene collaboration is paramount, but don't get stomped on. Figure out a direction and psychology for your character and draw a mental general picture you would like the scene to reflect, and go from there. If you want to steer things in a particular direction, take such opportunities when they present themselves.\n\nScenes are where things that have happened shine in the spotlight.\n\n\n### *Subsystem for Played Scenes*\n\nA new subsystem is in place, designed to structure the proposal of Played Scenes. \n\nThe first part of the system is a new Checklist Card in Synopsis & Instruction that serves as a Played Scenes counter. Whenever a player add a Played Scene he also adds a checklist element to this counter. When the counter reaches THREE (3) yet unplayed Played Scenes, normal game flow is suspended at the end of the current TURN (the player currently playing finishes his turn, he is the one that added the last played scene so this is straightforward).\n\nA Scene Day is organized as early as possible, in the next few weeks most likely, with the usual selection process. Whoever can't make it will have to regretfully pass on the played scene.\n\nEach scene is played normally but a time constraint is applied to it. Each scene must last at most ALLOTTED TIME / NUMBER OF SCENES or, more easily, ONE HOUR.\n\nAll currently unplayed Played Scenes *MUST* be played in the session.\n\nOnce all unplayed Played Scenes are played normal game flow is resumed.\n\n\n## Legacies\n\nA new mechanic is added to each turn, beside the Lens, the Focus and the normal Legacy: the Legacy Overthrow Allowance. This mechanic allows for a certain number of Focus Overthrows per turn. The number of Overthrows can be calculated with ROUND ( PLAYERS / 3 ).\n\nAn Overthrow allows a player that is making use of it to disregard the current Focus and instead use a Legacy as if it was the Focus.\n\nAs Legacy Overthrow Allowances are limited per turn they operate on a first-come first-serve basis. Once the current turn allowances are exhausted, they are re-instituted at the beginning of the next turn.\n\nThe Lens is barred from using Allowances during his Lens Turn.\n\nIf by the end of a turn one of more allowances are still available, ONE allowance is added to the subsequent turn's pool of available Overthrows.\n\nUnder Overthrow you are restricted to Events and Dictated Scenes, just as you would be when playing a standard Legacy.\n\nAn Event or Scene played under Overthrow is labelled as a Legacy, and it must be properly marked with the Legacy used just as a normal Legacy would be."
